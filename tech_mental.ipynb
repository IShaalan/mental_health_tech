       "      <td>[nan, I tried to answer as good as possible but I am CEO of a company so many questions don't fit very well.Also many of the questions are very US-centric in most systems healthcare is not your employers business., In australia all organisations of a certain size have to provide free access to a 'employee assistance program' to discuss work and personal issues.EAPs are an external provider totally confidential and anonymous (ring up andsay the name of who you work for - so they know to bill your work)  and they offer phone and face to face consults., Israel has public health insurance for everyone. Everyone has free mental health coverage and it's quite good. So that explains some of my answers., In Russia we have mandatory medical insurance. Every employer must pay 3.6% of every employee's salary to the insurance fund like a tax. Everyone gets free healthcare at public clinics and hospitals. Some types of healthcare including mental health are still funded from the government budget but that doesn't matter it's still FREE!However this is Russia :D I don't know much about what actually happens in mental hospitals here except that a lot of young people with male in their passports use these to avoid military draft and doctors seem to help them.,  , Autism is a bitch for those living with it and living it. For the past years I've really been working hard to get myself (known) in the community. The people in the community that know can be counted on one hand. In general I'm not telling anyway unless it really matters and it would be a gain in some way or the other. Not because I don't trust the community members close to me but because I don't want to be that guy. And IMHO it doesn't and shouldn't matter but sadly some people are funky about that. Yet sometimes I wan't to tell everyone what I've been through and share my lessons learned., I have chronic low-level neurological issues that have mental health side effects. One of my supervisors has also experienced similar neurological problems so I feel more comfortable being open about my issues than I would with someone without that experience. , I've answered 'Yes' on remote working but 50% is the maximum time we're allowed.The branch of the company I work for doesn't offer any medical benefits. It's not as common in the UK as we have the NHS for the moment. There are international branches that may so I've answered 'Don't know'., I'm troubled by the way that our hiring process tends to filter out non-neurotypicals of all stripes. Competent people who act a little funny can be hard to hire., It's a small startup in a small city in a small country., While not personally affected I do have immediate family with mental health illness and my employer has been very supportive. Thanks for doing this survey., Though I'm in the Netherlands and chose that country from the list quite some questions are strongly geared towards the US. Over here people don't need benefits from their employer because we pay enough taxes for the government to pay for treatment of any physical or mental condition. We don't need employer approval for medical leave; that's something a qualified medical professional decides (and while on leave we still get paid our salaries something the employer can get insurance for). I answered yes to questions about these things meaning it's covered not it's covered by my employer., For clarity I work at a casino., I am a 15 year vet of the industry and I get 2 weeks of combined sick and vacation time a year and I have children to fit into that too. I've had heart problems from the stress. Fuck everything about startup culture. , Stigma is the worst. People first language is a small step but we can't get that right., I currently have the best managers I've ever worked with. I don't have any issues but one of my coworkers recently did and it was handled extremely well. , Regardless of a stated lack of negative consequences for discussing mental health issues with coworkers/superiors unconscious bias is a very real thing - as long as I don't *need* to inform my co-workers my mental health issues do not need to be public knowledge., I am a Trans woman and suffer from depression relating to that. I'm a contractor so I've answered the questions as relating to my current contract., My work is using my brain. I do it incredibly well.I make an effort to avoid diagnosis of anything mental health related because I am convinced it would only affect me negatively., I was (wrongly) diagnosed clinically depressed at 12 then bipolar I at 15 and medicated for a decade until decided myself to go drug free. Since then I've never been happier. Insomnia and my insatiablility for learning and programming have always had a symbiotic  relationship.It might also bear mentioning that I'm self-employed in addition to my more traditional day job., I'm not on my company's health insurance which could be part of the reason I answered Don't know to so many questions., Since I am the CEO of my startup some of the would you feel comfortable and do you know the policy questions are interesting.  Of course I feel comfortable since no one can fire me and I know the policies because I chose them!However now I am curious if my employees know just how supportive the company would be of their mental health needs and this survey is making me realize that we probably haven't done a great job communicating that to everyone.  Thanks for doing this., I answered based on previous job at large technical company where I was pushed out of my role within 3 months of disclosing diagnosis.I had been struggling for 3 months prior to disclosure and was incredibly relieved when finally diagnosed. Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) deserved stress was anxiety caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing I didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing) I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day four years later despite being stable I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that it would be seen as oh I'm sorry. I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.2) Accomodations.- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive unnecessary appointment).- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and putting on my dick hat to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being medically disqualified from this role. I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost., I work for a very small firm that doesn't really have a dedicated H/R person. Also for the question:If you have a mental health condition do you feel that it interferes with your work?...I don't have a diagnosed mental health condition but I suspect I might have some slight depression issues. Definitely have Imposter Syndrome., None of us who are already in marginal groups in tech--the non-young the non-male the non-white--will risk our careers to admit another source of stigma: poor health., My employer employs 17k people worldwide and my previous employer only 140 globally both have been very supportive and accommodating with my moderate depression and intense anxiety., I talked to a psychiatrist once about taking medical leave for mental health issues with his referral. He was willing to help but warned me that I may not want to as he's seen that sort of thing follow people throughout their tech careers (word gets out even if it's confidential at work). I've been terrified of bringing mental health up anywhere that coworkers or potential employers could see ever since., The thought of going through my employer directly to get help is fucking scary.Getting help is the hardest part of getting help., I bring up my depression in interviews solely because I have a large gap on my CV due to mental health issues which could be mistaken for a gap taken to say have children which I feel would harm my chances much more. I have other MH issues I would never bring up with employers or peers., Had a co-worker disappear from work for a few weeks and then come back to let everyone know he was bipolar. His responsibilities and schedule were adjusted to accommodate but he got worse didn't show up didn't work etc and was eventually let go.It was tough because on the one hand he was struggling with some mental health issues but on the other hand he went through a period of months where he wasn't performing., I don't have a job :D, Relatively new job. Ask again later, I would add that while there were negative consequences for coworkers with mental health they were given a HUGE amount of leeway.  I think the team at large tried their best to be kind but that's how the person suffered.  The company actually gave this person a lot of help.  Which was cool.  But the team still discriminated., My refer to the mental health issue of depression.  I might answer differently if I was talking about a more serious issue like schizophrenia, i'm in a country with social health care so my options are not dependant on my employer. this makes a few of the early questions less relevant than they would be for a resident of the US., A lot of these answers aren't really applicable since I'm self employed as a sole proprietor., Thank you this is very important., Bipolar spectrum is tricky., Thank you for shining a light on this topic., Many of these questions were difficult to answer as a self-employed person; I did my best with the available options., My employer is extremely easy to work with and e.g. I have enormous leeway with flex time so I could take care of myself under that umbrella but I don't know and don't have a history of bring up mental health at the workplace so I am cautious in that area., To be self employed helps but also brings you in touch with lots of new people that you might have to explain yourself to., So much depends upon the organization. , My current work situation was constructed in part because of my mental health issues. One of the reasons I'm self employed is to give me the most flexibility for coping with my mental health issues.I have been removed from a client project in the past because of a mental health condition. This was while I was an employee for a large consulting company. , Sometimes I think  about using drugs for my mental health issues. If i use drugs I feel better, Family history of depression.  Currently dealing with depression and anxiety as well as drug addition.Employer provides &amp; pays premiums on insurance which covers therapy and prescriptions.  Employer allows work-from-home and unlimited PTO which makes episodes easier to control.I don't speak of my problems to anyone at work except for the people that I consider friends and even then I don't go into great detail.I would never bring up a mental health issue during an interview for fear of discrimination and rejection (and therefore greater depression).  One co-worker had serious anxiety problems and would not inform his team of episodes and was eventually let go for being unresponsive., Some of these should not be required., My employer does what they can providing a wellness program and pointing it out after particularly stressful times. But the interaction between the wellness program and the medical insurance is unpleasant and finding a long-term therapist / psychiatrist covered by insurance is amazingly difficult. My current lack of active treatment is due to insurance friction more than workplace friction., Nice job on the text field for gender :-), These result may be a tad confusing so a summary follows.* Currently self-employed so employer is me :)* Last place of employment was amazing when I first discovered I was bi-polar and helped me as long as I was there up to and including a mental health course for the whole team (although no mention why to others which was great).* I've never had a negative reaction yet but I know others who have.* I've been very lucky with company I keep which is why my experience is largely good., We don't fucking talk about it ever., Some of these questions are not really suitable for non US people., suffer from CR-PTSD so all answered based on that, The data will be skewed for self-employed people as the questions contain some bias.Having said that: being self-employed I *choose* to work for companies which want to employ *me* not just my skills but including my opinions my life-experience etc. If a potential contract/job doesn't *feel* right I prefer to not take it (and be poor) than to compromise myself., * Small family business - YMMV., My mental health issues were the direct result of the trauma from childhood abuse. Most (all?) of the Prompt-sponsored/related presentations I've seen have been about congenital mental health issues that are treatable with continued medication. For me medication only provided temporary assistance. I needed years of (continuing) therapy to deal with PTSD and related disorders (depression anxiety suicidal tendencies others). I haven't seen many in our community discussing trauma-related mental health issues but they are just as real and just as debilitating., Despite the impression that several 'no' responses might give my employer has been very supportive. But then I work in health care., This survey was tough as a self-employed individual. You may wish to discard responses from self employed people for much of your analysis., I think I am very lucky in my workplace. Our CEO has a degree in psychology., I'm afraid I haven't seen mental health issues arise at work yet. They are very accommodating with maternity leave but I don't know how that translates to anything else., thanks for what you're doing. FYI these questions dont quite work for entrepreneurs where employer == cofounders / sr mgmt / me, Hi Ed it's Paul Dragoonis. I have Aspergers/High Functioning Autism :-), I think a lot of our policy is based on a situation that occurred in the past 5 years. A very public mental illness happened with a coworker that unfortunately ended negatively. It was definitely a catalyst to talking about our options but the overall sentiment of it being OK to take time off talk with your supervisors etc. has always been there. It's a great company., A strong mind goes a long way. Stay strong. Take some time off to help. Its all in your head. , Would you bring up a mental health issue with a potential employer in an interview?Poignant., I work at a large university with a track record of health and wellbeing support, My employer gives access to basic counseling and referrals but I don't know (and it's not obvious) what might be covered in the way of expenses for therapy medication etc., I openly discuss my mental health struggles. I have found that doing so encourages people who also struggle to seek treatment. I'm willing to risk losing the support of people who don't understand if it helps those who understand all too well., I mostly suffer from social anxiety which keeps me from attending conferences. In my small dev group a big problem is a supervisor who's a workaholic and will never say no when asked to do something so he's doing the job of at least two ppl (poorly) and working crazy hours setting the tone for the test of us that work/life balance isn't important., (yes but the situation was unusual and involved a change in leadership at a very high level in the organization as well as an extended leave of absence), I should note one of the places my employer fails with regards to mental health is that the company-paid health insurance policy does not cover trans healthcare needs., YOU MAY WANT TO THROW OUT MY ENTRY.I answered all of these questions with the assumption that Attention Deficit Disorder is considered a mental illness and with ADD in mind., Thank you for your work what you do is important!, as a UK-based company we don't have any medical provisions as it's all provided on the National Health Service (for now!) However if we do need to take days off for any kind of health problems everyone is understanding :), When I've had a depression I was lucky to have an awesome manager who was very understanding and found a budget to pay for my therapy sessions., When you are an introvert people don't notice if you are depressed. Its a vicious cycle of sorts., A co-worker recently had mental health issues and my employer was very reasonable with them I don't know the full story but I do know that he was given ample time off and eased back in to the work place., Thanks for doing this. It will help end the stigma!, Just starting a new job hence the numerous I don't know selections., Our health plan has covered my psychotherapy and my antidepressant medication. My manager has been aware but discreet throughout. I did get negative reviews when my depression was trashing my delivery but y'know I wasn't delivering., I'm comfortable talking about mental health with my current supervisor &amp; my immediate at my current job but this is a first for me!, I am a contractor so my lack of knowledge of workplace wellness stems directly from my lack of access to that material since I am not covered by it. I am aware that mental health services are available and am aware of a colleague who has taken a leave of absence to deal with mental health issues but am otherwise uninformed., Thank you for all you are doing to study this topic and raise awareness in our communities. , This issue for me is very real at the moment. I have missed several days of work recently because of a bad reaction to a depression/anxiety drug and I hate not being able to discuss it with my boss without worrying that I will be labeled a liability. , Some of these questions were difficult to answer as being self-employed they didn't all apply to me., Bipolar disorder , A close family member of mine struggles with mental health so I try not to stigmatize it. My employers/coworkers also seem compassionate toward any kind of health or family needs., While I have not seen any direct retaliation against people with known mental illness many people do freely use insults commonly associated with mental illness (r****d for example) and criticize people behind their back for taking extra leave for doctor appointments (Oh I bet they are just hung over or other comments about how lazy they are.), I have only discussed my mental illness with close family members. I feel completely uncomfortable discussing with anyone at my place of employment as I am concerned it would have negative consequences., I went through a divorce and was pretty depressed I went to therapy and my boss (one of the owners) was extremely supportive. I'm not sure I would have got through that rough time with out my co-workers and boss., Now at starutp.  Previously worked at big tech company which was actually quite good at supporting mental health issues.  Still wouldn't share with bosses/other employees though as there remains a strong negative stigma., It might be safe to talk about it where I am now but I don't know for sure and I err on the side of being over cautious. Struggle with depression and anxiety which sometimes affects my productivity but I try to make up / cover up for it instead of being open about it., I feel like most of my answers were useless due to answering that I am self-employed early on. Since my employer is me... my employer does/doesn't offer mental health benefits or would I be comfortable bring it up with 'them' doesn't make sense..., Majority of qs on survey not relevant if you are self employed, One of my coworkers has mental health issues and she's open about them (eg: my enjoyment of this project may be due to my recent change in meds). I believe the response has been generally supportive. We're a very small tight-knit company., I selected my current employer based on its policies about self care and the quality of their overall health and wellness benefits. I still have residual caution from previous employers who ranged from ambivalent to indifferent to actively hostile regarding mental health concerns., I work for a university., In small startups it is very hard to keep mental health issues truly private no matter what management does., I'd be more worried about coworkers and workplace culture than the employer--they're probably legally obligated to do some things but reputation among people I work with is something else. For instance I've heard people make snide remarks about men taking paternity leave I don't want to know what they'd say about mental health leave., ...]</td>\n",

When disclosing I didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing) I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day four years later despite being stable I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that it would be seen as oh I'm sorry. I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.2) Accomodations.- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive unnecessary appointment).- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and putting on my dick hat to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being medically disqualified from this role. I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost.\", \"Continent\": \"N_America\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"2014-08-27 11:40:51\", \"Age\": 40.0, \"Gender\": \"Female\", \"Country\": \"United States\", \"state\": \"WI\", \"self_employed\": \"No\", \"family_history\": \"No\", \"treatment\": \"Yes\", \"work_interfere\": \"Sometimes\", \"no_employees\": \"1-5\", \"remote_work\": \"No\", \"tech_company\": \"Yes\", \"benefits\": \"Yes\", \"care_options\": \"Yes\", \"wellness_program\": \"No\", \"seek_help\": \"No\", \"anonymity\": \"Don't know\", \"leave\": \"Don't know\", \"mental_health_consequence\": \"Maybe\", \"phys_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"coworkers\": \"Some of them\", \"supervisor\": \"No\", \"mental_health_interview\": \"No\", \"phys_health_interview\": \"Maybe\", \"mental_vs_physical\": \"Yes\", \"obs_consequence\": \"No\", \"comments\": null, \"Continent\": \"N_America\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"2014-08-27 12:42:24\", \"Age\": 25.0, \"Gender\": \"Male\", \"Country\": \"United States\", \"state\": \"IL\", \"self_employed\": \"No\", \"family_history\": \"Yes\", \"treatment\": \"Yes\", \"work_interfere\": \"Sometimes\", \"no_employees\": \"26-100\", \"remote_work\": \"No\", \"tech_company\": \"No\", \"benefits\": \"Don't know\", \"care_options\": \"No\", \"wellness_program\": \"No\", \"seek_help\": \"Don't know\", \"anonymity\": \"Don't know\", \"leave\": \"Somewhat difficult\", \"mental_health_consequence\": \"Maybe\", \"phys_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"coworkers\": \"Some of them\", \"supervisor\": \"Some of them\", \"mental_health_interview\": \"No\", \"phys_health_interview\": \"Maybe\", \"mental_vs_physical\": \"No\", \"obs_consequence\": \"No\", \"comments\": null, \"Continent\": \"N_America\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"2014-08-29 11:27:47\", \"Age\": 41.0, \"Gender\": \"Male\", \"Country\": \"United States\", \"state\": \"IL\", \"self_employed\": \"Yes\", \"family_history\": \"No\", \"treatment\": \"Yes\", \"work_interfere\": \"Often\", \"no_employees\": \"1-5\", \"remote_work\": \"Yes\", \"tech_company\": \"No\", \"benefits\": \"No\", \"care_options\": \"Yes\", \"wellness_program\": \"Yes\", \"seek_help\": \"Yes\", \"anonymity\": \"Yes\", \"leave\": \"Very difficult\", \"mental_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"phys_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"coworkers\": \"Some of them\", \"supervisor\": \"Some of them\", \"mental_health_interview\": \"No\", \"phys_health_interview\": \"No\", \"mental_vs_physical\": \"Yes\", \"obs_consequence\": \"Yes\", \"comments\": null, \"Continent\": \"N_America\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"2014-08-28 11:14:21\", \"Age\": 35.0, \"Gender\": \"Male\", \"Country\": \"United States\", \"state\": \"CA\", \"self_employed\": \"No\", \"family_history\": \"Yes\", \"treatment\": \"Yes\", \"work_interfere\": \"Rarely\", \"no_employees\": \"6-25\", \"remote_work\": \"No\", \"tech_company\": \"Yes\", \"benefits\": \"Yes\", \"care_options\": \"Yes\", \"wellness_program\": \"Yes\", \"seek_help\": \"Yes\", \"anonymity\": \"Yes\", \"leave\": \"Very easy\", \"mental_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"phys_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"coworkers\": \"Some of them\", \"supervisor\": \"Yes\", \"mental_health_interview\": \"No\", \"phys_health_interview\": \"No\", \"mental_vs_physical\": \"Yes\", \"obs_consequence\": \"No\", \"comments\": \"Since I am the CEO of my startup some of the would you feel comfortable and do you know the policy questions are interesting.

Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) deserved stress was anxiety caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing I didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing) I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day four years later despite being stable I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that it would be seen as oh I'm sorry. I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.2) Accomodations.- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive unnecessary appointment).- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and putting on my dick hat to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being medically disqualified from this role. I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost.\", \"Continent\": \"N_America\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"2014-08-27 11:40:51\", \"Age\": 40.0, \"Gender\": \"Female\", \"Country\": \"United States\", \"state\": \"WI\", \"self_employed\": \"No\", \"family_history\": \"No\", \"treatment\": \"Yes\", \"work_interfere\": \"Sometimes\", \"no_employees\": \"1-5\", \"remote_work\": \"No\", \"tech_company\": \"Yes\", \"benefits\": \"Yes\", \"care_options\": \"Yes\", \"wellness_program\": \"No\", \"seek_help\": \"No\", \"anonymity\": \"Don't know\", \"leave\": \"Don't know\", \"mental_health_consequence\": \"Maybe\", \"phys_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"coworkers\": \"Some of them\", \"supervisor\": \"No\", \"mental_health_interview\": \"No\", \"phys_health_interview\": \"Maybe\", \"mental_vs_physical\": \"Yes\", \"obs_consequence\": \"No\", \"comments\": null, \"Continent\": \"N_America\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"2014-08-27 12:42:24\", \"Age\": 25.0, \"Gender\": \"Male\", \"Country\": \"United States\", \"state\": \"IL\", \"self_employed\": \"No\", \"family_history\": \"Yes\", \"treatment\": \"Yes\", \"work_interfere\": \"Sometimes\", \"no_employees\": \"26-100\", \"remote_work\": \"No\", \"tech_company\": \"No\", \"benefits\": \"Don't know\", \"care_options\": \"No\", \"wellness_program\": \"No\", \"seek_help\": \"Don't know\", \"anonymity\": \"Don't know\", \"leave\": \"Somewhat difficult\", \"mental_health_consequence\": \"Maybe\", \"phys_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"coworkers\": \"Some of them\", \"supervisor\": \"Some of them\", \"mental_health_interview\": \"No\", \"phys_health_interview\": \"Maybe\", \"mental_vs_physical\": \"No\", \"obs_consequence\": \"No\", \"comments\": null, \"Continent\": \"N_America\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"2014-08-29 11:27:47\", \"Age\": 41.0, \"Gender\": \"Male\", \"Country\": \"United States\", \"state\": \"IL\", \"self_employed\": \"Yes\", \"family_history\": \"No\", \"treatment\": \"Yes\", \"work_interfere\": \"Often\", \"no_employees\": \"1-5\", \"remote_work\": \"Yes\", \"tech_company\": \"No\", \"benefits\": \"No\", \"care_options\": \"Yes\", \"wellness_program\": \"Yes\", \"seek_help\": \"Yes\", \"anonymity\": \"Yes\", \"leave\": \"Very difficult\", \"mental_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"phys_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"coworkers\": \"Some of them\", \"supervisor\": \"Some of them\", \"mental_health_interview\": \"No\", \"phys_health_interview\": \"No\", \"mental_vs_physical\": \"Yes\", \"obs_consequence\": \"Yes\", \"comments\": null, \"Continent\": \"N_America\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"2014-08-28 11:14:21\", \"Age\": 35.0, \"Gender\": \"Male\", \"Country\": \"United States\", \"state\": \"CA\", \"self_employed\": \"No\", \"family_history\": \"Yes\", \"treatment\": \"Yes\", \"work_interfere\": \"Rarely\", \"no_employees\": \"6-25\", \"remote_work\": \"No\", \"tech_company\": \"Yes\", \"benefits\": \"Yes\", \"care_options\": \"Yes\", \"wellness_program\": \"Yes\", \"seek_help\": \"Yes\", \"anonymity\": \"Yes\", \"leave\": \"Very easy\", \"mental_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"phys_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"coworkers\": \"Some of them\", \"supervisor\": \"Yes\", \"mental_health_interview\": \"No\", \"phys_health_interview\": \"No\", \"mental_vs_physical\": \"Yes\", \"obs_consequence\": \"No\", \"comments\": \"Since I am the CEO of my startup some of the would you feel comfortable and do you know the policy questions are interesting.

One co-worker had serious anxiety problems and would not inform his team of episodes and was eventually let go for being unresponsive.\", \"Continent\": \"N_America\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"2014-08-29

Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) deserved stress was anxiety caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing I didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing) I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day four years later despite being stable I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that it would be seen as oh I'm sorry. I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.2) Accomodations.- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive unnecessary appointment).- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and putting on my dick hat to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being medically disqualified from this role. I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost.\", \"Continent\": \"N_America\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"2014-08-27 11:40:51\", \"Age\": 40.0, \"Gender\": \"Female\", \"Country\": \"United States\", \"state\": \"WI\", \"self_employed\": \"No\", \"family_history\": \"No\", \"treatment\": \"Yes\", \"work_interfere\": \"Sometimes\", \"no_employees\": \"1-5\", \"remote_work\": \"No\", \"tech_company\": \"Yes\", \"benefits\": \"Yes\", \"care_options\": \"Yes\", \"wellness_program\": \"No\", \"seek_help\": \"No\", \"anonymity\": \"Don't know\", \"leave\": \"Don't know\", \"mental_health_consequence\": \"Maybe\", \"phys_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"coworkers\": \"Some of them\", \"supervisor\": \"No\", \"mental_health_interview\": \"No\", \"phys_health_interview\": \"Maybe\", \"mental_vs_physical\": \"Yes\", \"obs_consequence\": \"No\", \"comments\": null, \"Continent\": \"N_America\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"2014-08-27 12:42:24\", \"Age\": 25.0, \"Gender\": \"Male\", \"Country\": \"United States\", \"state\": \"IL\", \"self_employed\": \"No\", \"family_history\": \"Yes\", \"treatment\": \"Yes\", \"work_interfere\": \"Sometimes\", \"no_employees\": \"26-100\", \"remote_work\": \"No\", \"tech_company\": \"No\", \"benefits\": \"Don't know\", \"care_options\": \"No\", \"wellness_program\": \"No\", \"seek_help\": \"Don't know\", \"anonymity\": \"Don't know\", \"leave\": \"Somewhat difficult\", \"mental_health_consequence\": \"Maybe\", \"phys_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"coworkers\": \"Some of them\", \"supervisor\": \"Some of them\", \"mental_health_interview\": \"No\", \"phys_health_interview\": \"Maybe\", \"mental_vs_physical\": \"No\", \"obs_consequence\": \"No\", \"comments\": null, \"Continent\": \"N_America\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"2014-08-29 11:27:47\", \"Age\": 41.0, \"Gender\": \"Male\", \"Country\": \"United States\", \"state\": \"IL\", \"self_employed\": \"Yes\", \"family_history\": \"No\", \"treatment\": \"Yes\", \"work_interfere\": \"Often\", \"no_employees\": \"1-5\", \"remote_work\": \"Yes\", \"tech_company\": \"No\", \"benefits\": \"No\", \"care_options\": \"Yes\", \"wellness_program\": \"Yes\", \"seek_help\": \"Yes\", \"anonymity\": \"Yes\", \"leave\": \"Very difficult\", \"mental_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"phys_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"coworkers\": \"Some of them\", \"supervisor\": \"Some of them\", \"mental_health_interview\": \"No\", \"phys_health_interview\": \"No\", \"mental_vs_physical\": \"Yes\", \"obs_consequence\": \"Yes\", \"comments\": null, \"Continent\": \"N_America\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"2014-08-28 11:14:21\", \"Age\": 35.0, \"Gender\": \"Male\", \"Country\": \"United States\", \"state\": \"CA\", \"self_employed\": \"No\", \"family_history\": \"Yes\", \"treatment\": \"Yes\", \"work_interfere\": \"Rarely\", \"no_employees\": \"6-25\", \"remote_work\": \"No\", \"tech_company\": \"Yes\", \"benefits\": \"Yes\", \"care_options\": \"Yes\", \"wellness_program\": \"Yes\", \"seek_help\": \"Yes\", \"anonymity\": \"Yes\", \"leave\": \"Very easy\", \"mental_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"phys_health_consequence\": \"No\", \"coworkers\": \"Some of them\", \"supervisor\": \"Yes\", \"mental_health_interview\": \"No\", \"phys_health_interview\": \"No\", \"mental_vs_physical\": \"Yes\", \"obs_consequence\": \"No\", \"comments\": \"Since I am the CEO of my startup some of the would you feel comfortable and do you know the policy questions are interesting.
